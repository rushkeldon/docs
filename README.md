# docs

#### a repository for high level documentation (non-project specific)

## Why?

* documents have to live somewhere!
* developers are comfortable with github - so why not keep your docs there?

## Don't See Documentation You Would Like to See?

* Open an issue on this repo to make note of the documentation you would like to see
* Better yet, fork this project, make the document you want, create a pull request back to this repo!
